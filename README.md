# Confidence Intervals Simplified

This is an app written in Python (Flask) and Javascript to visualize and explain confidence intervals. Currently, only confidence intervals for hypothesis testing for population proportion are supported. In the future we plan to add more of the most common hypothesis tests.

Originally this app was used to explain hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to Data Science students at the Data Science Academy of Creative Hub Kosovo.
